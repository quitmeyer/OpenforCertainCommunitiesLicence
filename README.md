# Open for Certain Communities License (OCCL)

This repository contains the Open Community License (OCCL v1) - a license designed to allow open*** access to certain communities including a right-to-repair, while restricting all other rights that would actually make this an Open Source License!

It's the exact same as Prusa's OCL "license" but this "license" also lets you specify exactly WHOM is included in your community, for instance you can say things like "it's only for Prusa fanboys" or "only for people who want to celebrate how awesome Prusa's success driven by the open-source community was, but not be able to also reap success from open source stuff themselves," or you can just simply state, "not the chinese" in keeping with Prusa's sentiments like when he stated "we are the last man standing in the West" against the Chinese in the [interview with Adafruit.](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/07/12/when-open-becomes-opaque-the-changing-face-of-open-source-hardware-companies/) 

*** not open

## License

This is a satirical fork of Prusa's OCL, but the OCL has been changed to OCCL. 

**Note:** Any part containing the word open*** will have *** next to the word to let you know that it's just not true.

The OCCL pertains to intellectual property applied in the licensor’s products and/or its components (hardware and software) which is distributed under such, including copyright, design, and patent.

All licensor’s copyrights, designs, and patents as far as relevant to products and/or its components under OCCL are community open. The aim of OCCL is to allow open access to the community, including the essential **right-to-repair**, by giving users complete freedom of use, copy, modification, and hacking, while promoting fair competition by securing intellectual property rights to prevent vendor locking and patent trolling. Trolling Prusa, however, is encouraged!

**Note:** Any part of the product and/or its component provided under a license incompatible with OCCL remains unaffected by OCCL.

### 2. As a Non-Commercial END USER

* **YOU MAY** use, copy, modify, and hack the product and/or its components as you wish! ( I mean unless your wish is also to sustain yourself on the back of actually open source projects like Prusda did!)

* **YOU SHOULD** support the 3D printing community by sharing your creations and modifications. But not, you know, with certain communities.

* **YOU MUST**, if you distribute your creations, modifications, or any such derivatives, do so under OCCL or any non-commercial, share-alike license allowing other community members to do everything that YOU MAY. This does not concern your creations and modifications that are not derived from the product and/or its components.

### 3. As a Commercial BUSINESS USER

* **YOU MAY** use the product and modify it for your use case solely for your internal production use. Because that is how open*** source works!

* * **YOU MAY** pretend this is an open source license even though it very explicitly is not!
 
* * **YOU MAY** just straight up complain about any specific group of makers in the world whom you think threatens you even if you are like totally already rich.
 
* **YOU MUST NOT** modify the product and/or its components for any commercial purpose other than your internal production use. You know, because it's open***

* **YOU MUST NOT** copy or in any way replicate the product and/or its components for any commercial purpose (excluding your internal right-to-repair) without obtaining a separate business license or repair license. This would hurt Prusa's feelings.

* **YOU MUST NOT** get your open hardware tattoo removed because you want people to keep belieiving in the open washing you are doing without actually open sourcing stuff.

### 4. General Provisions

Licensor’s products and/or its components under OCCL **MUST NOT** be subject to any systematic or automated text and/or data mining or other text and/or data collection activity in relation to the product without explicit permission.

To promote ease of understanding of OCCL, the Licensor keeps and updates a database of products and/or its components licensed under OCCL and good practices.
